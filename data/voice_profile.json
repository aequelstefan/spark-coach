  "style": "Voice: casual, immediate, like Sherry Jang—starts mid-thought; lowercase sometimes OK; no polish.\nStructure: jump right in ('just realized', 'shipped X today', 'honestly'); 2–4 short sentences; personal story or moment.\nTone: honest, warm, real; show the messy bits; no corporate speak ever.\nEmoji: max 1, only ✨💡😅🧵; use sparingly.\nClosing: small insight or unfinished thought; invite replies naturally.\nNEVER use: 'strategic', 'optimize', 'leverage', 'trade-offs', 'first principles', 'synergy', formal business words.\nExamples: 'just realized...', 'shipped this yesterday...', 'honestly the hardest part...', 'tbh...'",
